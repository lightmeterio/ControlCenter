### About MJML

[MJML](https://mjml.io) is an open-sourced markup language, developed my [Mailjet](https://mailjet.com) used to generate the HTML of responsive email templates. 

#### Lightmeter's MJML template

You can find the MJML version of the template Lightmeter uses for it's email notification on this directory (/notification/email/templates/).

#### Generating the HTML version of it

The easiest way to do that is using the online MJML editor: https://mjml.io/try-it-live/
You can paste the MJML code here, edit and generate the updated HTML version by clicking: "Generate HTML"

Alternatively, you can download and use MJML locally following the steps outlined here: https://mjml.io/download

TODO: we should automate the process, as described on https://gitlab.com/lightmeter/controlcenter/-/issues/431
