**Attach logs**

Please consider attaching relevant mail logs to this issue - you can safely remove private data from them (email addresses, hostnames, IPs, etc)
using the [`tools/batch_log_cleaner.py`] script in this repository. That creates clean log copies without modifying your source logs.

You can run it like this:

```sh
./tools/batch_log_cleaner.py -i /var/log/ -o logs.tar.gz --complete
```

It'll generate a file logs.tar.gz with sample lines (by default 1000 lines) of the Postfix log files in /var/log, removing any sensitive data.

Please run such script on the original log files, or at least on a copy of such files that preserve the file modification time
(copied by rsync, for instance, instead of a plain "cp"), as such metadata is important for analysing the log files.

Please always check the contents of the `logs.tar.gz` file before sending it to us :-)

You can attach the `logs.tar.gz` file to this issue, or send it via e-mail to `hello@lightmeter.io` with the subject
`Log files for Gitlab issue #XXX`, where `#XXX` is the number assigned to the issue report you've just created
(you can copy if from the URL or from the top of the page).
